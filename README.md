# genomicProject

Overview

genomicProject is a repository containing scripts designed to analyze output files from genomic tools like Lirical and Exomiser. The project facilitates replacing gene IDs with symbols, managing input and output files, and other essential genomic data operations.

### Directory Structure

exomiser: Contains Exomiser related files and scripts.
exomiserInput.csv: Input file format for Exomiser.
exomiserScript.py: Python script facilitating Exomiser operations.
all-variant-files: Directory for storing variant files related to Exomiser.
lirical: Contains Lirical related files and scripts.
GeneDirectory.csv: Directory providing a mapping of gene IDs to their corresponding symbols.
liricalScript.py: Python script facilitating Lirical operations.
replaceGeneID.py: A tool to replace gene IDs with respective symbols in Lirical output files.
lirical-files: Directory for storing additional Lirical related files.
README.md: This documentation file.

### Script Descriptions

1. exomiserScript.py
Located in the exomiser directory, this script is tailored for Exomiser operations. Details on its exact functionality and how to use it should be consulted within the script's comments or documentation.

2. liricalScript.py
Found in the lirical directory, this script is designed to handle operations specific to Lirical outputs. Consult the script's internal comments or documentation for precise usage instructions.

3. replaceGeneID.py
This script, part of the lirical directory, aids in replacing gene IDs in Lirical output files with their corresponding symbols from the GeneDirectory.csv.
